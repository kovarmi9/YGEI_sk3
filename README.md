## Repository Contents

### [U1 - JPEG Raster Compression](https://github.com/kovarmi9/YGEI_sk3/tree/main/U1)
This folder contains the implementation of the algorithms for JPEG compression and decompression of raster images in MATLAB. It includes:
- Code for transforming to the Y CB CR model
- Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
- Quantization of coefficients
- Testing results on various types of rasters (grayscale, color) with different compression factors
- Evaluation of results

Additionally, this folder includes the following optional tasks:
- Resampling of raster using 2X2 and Nearest Neigbour 
- Conversion of pixels to ZIG-ZAG sequences
- Huffman coding
- Replacement of DCT with Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- Replacement of DCT with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
